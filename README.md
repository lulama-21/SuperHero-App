# Marvel-Themed HTML & CSS Practice

This repository contains a simple static website created as part of my learning journey in **HTML5 and CSS3**. It is focused on building individual character pages (like Hulk, Iron Man, Thor) with consistent layout and styling, helping me practice layout techniques, element positioning, and responsive design.

## ðŸ’» What I Used
- **HTML5** for structure and semantic elements
- **CSS3** for layout, spacing, fonts, and basic styling
- Folder structure includes a shared `style.css` and individual HTML pages

## ðŸ“„ Pages Included
- `index.html`: Home page
- `hulk.html`, `ironman.html`, `thor.html`: Individual character pages
- `/images`: Contains related image assets

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of This Project
- Practice CSS styling (typography, layout, colors, buttons, etc.)
- Understand how to link multiple pages
- Work with external stylesheets
- Learn GitHub project structure and version control basics

## ðŸš€ Future Plans
- Add hover effects and transitions
- Explore responsive design (media queries)
- Build a navigation bar
- Eventually connect with JavaScript to add interactivity
